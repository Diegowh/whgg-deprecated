# WH.GG 

>This application is a re-envisioned version of my previous project, wh.gg, which was originally created using Flask. However, this iteration has been developed using Django purely for the purpose of learning the framework. While the majority of my focus was on the backend, I did utilize a third-party front-end template, which I modified to meet my requirements and needs. Ultimately, the goal of this project was to learn Django, enhance my backend skills, and gain proficiency with Django's native ORM for database management.

>This application is a streamlined version, inspired by web apps such as op.gg, u.gg, and porofessor.gg. It leverages the Riot Games API as the primary data source and displays a summoner's data.

>One significant constraint is the application's response speed, which is unfortunately unavoidable due to the request limit set by Riot Games.
